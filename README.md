# Machine Learning from Movie Reviews

The idea of this project is that there are many sources of consumer reviews which can be mined for data. 
This data can then be used to either:
	a) prompt specific activities in response
	b) create reviews based on others' opinions

I decided to work with movie reviews, because there are many databases already created for them, and 
the information in the reviews can be used to predict a number of different things about the movie, 
such as whether it was a "good" or "bad" movie, or what genre the movie was. While these predictions
are not of particular value in and of themselves, they are placeholders, indicating the types of
predictions that Natural Language Processing of reviews can be used for -- both boolean and categorical.
